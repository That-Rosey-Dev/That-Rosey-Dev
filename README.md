### Introduction!
Hello! I'm That Rosey Dev. I'm a freelance developer. I use c++(Currently learning.), and HTML5/CSS/Javascript, and Node.js.
My current project I'm working on is the **"Golden Rose"** Discord Bot. I will keep you updated on the public repo for the **"Golden Rose"** bot.
Most of the bot's code will be placed on a private repo so it can be hosted. The bot's website will be hosted on the public repo.
