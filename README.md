Hello! I'm That Rosey Dev. I'm a freelance developer. I use c++(Currently learning.), and HTML5/CSS/Javascript, and Node.js.
My current project I'm working on is the **"Golden Rose"** Discord Bot. I will keep you updated on the public repo for the **"Golden Rose"** bot.
Most of the bot's code will be placed on a private repo so it can be hosted. The bot's website will be hosted on the public repo.
If you have any questions about my project, or any suggestions or tips for my project feel free to reach out to my [email](thatroseydev@gmail.com)!
